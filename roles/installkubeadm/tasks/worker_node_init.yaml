# Register nodes_that_should_be_joined in the scope of the control plane host.
# `hostvars` is a dict of `inventory_hostname`=>dict{all defined variables in its scope}.
# The name of the node in kubernetes is the hostname as saved on the machine's /etc/hosts,
# which is saved as an ansible fact in e.g.
# hostvars['workerX.sciencedata.dk']['ansible_hostname'].
# This chain of filters proceeds as follows:
#   hostvars: {inventory_hostname: {... ansible_hostname: 'its hostname from /etc/hosts'}}
#   dict2items(hostvars) <- [{key: inventory_hostname, value: {... ansible_hostname:...}}]
#   selectattr keeps only the entries in the list whose `key` exists in the
#     worker_nodes group (i.e. discards the hostvars of non-worker nodes)
#   map(attribute='value') applies the attr('value') filter on each element in the list,
#     resulting in [{... ansible_hostname: 'its hostname from /etc/hosts'}]
#   map(attribute='ansible_hostname') returns ['its hostname from /etc/hosts']
